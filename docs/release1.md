# Documentation release 1

## Planning the project

### Meeting 1 - Coop-contract
The very first meeting with the team was spent writing the coop-contract.  

### Meeting 2 - Choosing Project
In the second meeting we discussed several different projects to do and landed on a travel-journal application. Our argumentation for this choice is that this is both something we saw a need for, it is easy to come up with new features and it covers all the guidelines from the course-team.  
We also decided on guidelines for using git:

### Meeting 3 - Planning Sprint 1
In the third meeting we created a backlog and made a plan for the sprint regarding release 1. Here we divided the assignment given to us into smaller subtasks. Then we created an issue for each substask. This made it possible for us to have an organized and clearly defined plan of what we needed to do to complete sprint 1. From the description of group assignment 1 we created 26 issues regarding frontend, backend, and documentation with defined importances. We planned to at least complete all of the tasks marked with "high priority" by the end of the sprint. The end of the sprint was set as the deadline for the group assignment. To be able to complete these tasks we decided to assign the issues evenly across the members of the group. We also arranged three meetings before the end of the sprint where we were going to develop together and go through what each member had done individually since the last meeting.

To have a visual representation of what we were going to make, we created pictures showing what we visualized the app would look like at the end of development. We made two frames in Figma. One for the front-page with a list over places you have been been and another one for the page containing information about a spesific destination. The plan is to be able to click on a destination on the front page to get transfered to the page with information about that destination.

By clearly defining what we were going to do, how we were going to do it and distributing the tasks evenly across the members of the group, we were now ready to start development.

We also made a conceptual model to make sure we had the same underlying intetions of the applications design. The conceptual model makes the basic functionality of the system clear. By having a model that relates to the users' mental model, we make it easier to explain our intentions with the app.

### Meeting 4 - Tying things together
While we were approaching the end of sprint 1, we decided to have a final meeting to complete the remaining tasks and polish the project before delivery. Here we cleaned our code and rewrote parts of the documentation.

We also figured that the complexity of the app was just going to increase over time and wanted to assure that everyone had a clear understadning of the system we had built so far. We therefore decided to make a UML class diagram of our project to have a clear representation of what role every class played in the system. By designing a UML class diagram, we made it clear for all members of the group what every class does and how the classes relates to each other. This insures that all member understand the structure of the project which will help development get more organized and faster later on. There are a lot of different diagrams that help memebers get a quick overview of the projects structure. However, we were looking for a way of giving a good understanding of the classes, methods and how they were all connected. For this purpose, a UML class diagrams is the superior option.
