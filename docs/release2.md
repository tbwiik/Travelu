# Documentation release 2

## Current functionality of the project
In the second release, we have mainly focused on further developing the backend side of the functionality from release1. This is because developing a solid backend foundation makes implementing frontend features more straight forward later. In release 2 we have restructured our entire project, implemented spotbugs, written multiple tests, both for frontend and backend. 

Additionally we have all the functionality from release 1.

## Sprint 2 - Restructuring the project

### Meeting 1 - Sprint review and sprint planning
We started of sprint 2 by reviewing what we did well and what we could improve on from sprint 1. Generally everyone in the group were satisfied with the workflow and division of labor. However, the group members also agreed on some improvements that could be made. Examples were being more consistent on conventions for commit messages from https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ and branch naming from https://codingsight.com/git-branching-naming-convention-best-practices/. This would make it easier to read and understand changes were we had made when looking back on them. We also agreed to write more documentation continuously to avoid having to write all the documentation at the end of the sprint when useful details about the development process may have been forgotten.

After reviewing sprint 1, we could then make a better plan for sprint 2. We started of by creating 18 issues based on the desctiption of the group assignment and assigned them accross the group members. Our main goal for this sprint was to restructure our project by modularizing and placing backend, frontend and persistence in seperate folders. In sprint 1 we only assigned ourselves to issues one by one. However, we found this to be suboptimal where multiple members sometimes ended up working on similar issues which resulted in some of the work overlapping. To avoid this we now assigned ourselves to multiple issues at the same time if the issues were related. By continuing to do what worked well in sprint 1 and improving on the problems stated above, we were now ready to start development in sprint 2.


### Meeting 2 - Pair programming
Previously, most of the work done by our members were done individually. However, our team wanted to try a new approach to development which was pair programming. By being two people working on the same problem at once, it is eaiser to spot potential bugs and find clever solutions while programming. Our main goal for this sprint was to make a logical structure of our project. Since this can be done in a lot of different ways and requires a lot of intuitive thinking, we figured this was greatly sutied for and a good time utilize the benefits of pair programming. We seperated into two pairs where one pair worked on the structure of the project while the other pair worked on implemening tests which is also sutied for pair programming by being highly logical work that also can be done in a lot of ways. When working in pairs however, it is easy to let one person develop while the other person watches passivly. To avoid this we alternated between which person was coding and who was watching. By doing this we made sure both were activly engaging in the code and activly developing. 



## Sprint 3 - Making a solid foundation for future releases

### Meeting 1 - Sprint Review and sprint planning

new workflow - chose to make merge requests immediately when beginning to work on an issue. This makes for a clear and structured workflow.
