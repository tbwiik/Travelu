# Explorer wanting to visit every country
I am an explorer who is on a mission to visit every country in the world. I want to have a structured list of all the places I have been. It is going to be a lot of countries. To be able to look up countries quicker, I therefore want to be able to sort the countries alphabetically. I also want a way to easily compare the countries. 
I also want to be able to sort the countries by rating to easily compare them.

The user needs to be able to sort the countries alphabetically to find specific countries quicker. The user also needs to be able to sort the countries by rating to be able to compare them.

## Important to be able to see
- An alphabetically sorted list of all the countries the user has visited.
- A list of all the countries the user has visited sorted by rating.

## Important to be able to do
- Add new countries the user has visited.
- Sort the countries alphabetically.
