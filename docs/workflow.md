## Sprints
Each time our group is handed a new assignment, we set up sprints to have a concrete plan of what we are going to do. Usually we create one sprint per week. Having sprints is a good way of creating deadlines for which issues we will finish at what time.

A big part of scrum is to have a iterative process where you get feedback for each sprint which you can then use to redirect your product on to the right path. In this way, the the team figures out what the end product should look like bit by bit instead of having a clear vision of the end goal from the beginning. Since we are not getting any feedback along the way, the iterative part of scrum is lost. However, the group can reflect for themselves and

Each week we arrange at least two meetings. The first one being on monday and the second one on friday.
