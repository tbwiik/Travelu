# Influencer keeping track of visited places
As a travel vlogger, it is important for me to be able to keep track of my travels so that I can keep creating content from these trips. I need to remember what I did when visiting these places, because my followers might be interested in hearing about it.

The user needs to be able to rate the different destinations, to keep track of what places were the most enjoyable, and use this to determine what to use for content creation.

## Important to be able to see
- Activities the user has done at these places.
- A description of the trip.
- Rating of destinations.

## Important to be able to do
