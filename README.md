### Boilerplate and Gitpod
Integrated functions in VSCode was used to create a boilerplate for the project. This ensured that everything was added correctly.
We then followed up with changing **pom.xml** with the correct version for running on silicon macs and adding dependencies for testing.

Gitpod-tag got added to the README.md in root to enable remote work and easy access for the course-team
