## Release 1

### Planning the project

The very first meeting with the team was spent writing the coop-contract.  

In the second meeting we discussed several different projects to do and landed on a travel-journal application. Our argumentation for this choice is that this is both something we saw a need for, it is easy to come up with new features and it covers all the guidelines from the course-team.  
We also decided on guidelines for using git:

In the third meeting we created a backlog and defined the sprint for release 1, ref **Issues**.

### Boilerplate and Gitpod
Integrated functions in VSCode was used to create a boilerplate for the project. This ensured that everything was added correctly.
We then followed up with changing **pom.xml** with the correct version for running on silicon macs and adding dependencies for testing.

Gitpod-tag got added to the README.md in root to enable remote work and easy access for the course-team
