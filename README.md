- Tests for the application's domain logic which are in the folder [travelu/core/src/test/java/travelu/core](travelu/core/src/test/java/travelu/core)
- Tests for the application's persistence which are in the folder [travelu/localpersistence/src/test/java/travelu/localpersistence](travelu/localpersistence/src/test/java/travelu/localpersistence)
- An ingegration test for the application which is in the folder [travelu/integrationtests/src/test/java/travelu/integrationtests](travelu/integrationtests/src/test/java/travelu/integrationtests)

## Building & running the project

The project is built with maven.
To run the project, in terminal:

- `cd travelu` to change into project-folder
- `mvn install` in root folder
  - **Note:** this also runs tests and installs package
- `mvn -pl restserver spring-boot:run` to start the server handling the rest-api
- `mvn -pl fxui javafx:run` to start the application

**Notice:**   
[fxui/module-info](travelu/fxui/src/main/java/) is deleted for enabling run through Maven.  
See [module-info](docs/development/module-info.md) for explanation

## Testing & coverage

After building project, run the following commands in terminal to run tests and generate coverage reports:

- `cd travelu` to change into project-folder
- Run `mvn test` to get test results
- Run `mvn verify` to get test-coverage and quality report
- Report found in [travelu/core/target/site/jacoco/index.html](travelu/core/target/site/jacoco/index.html)

See documentaion about [test coverage](docs/qualityAssurance/testCoverage.md) for more information.

**NOTE:** The UI tests will fail if you have a spring-boot server running when you run the tests. You can either stop the server or run the tests with the `-DskipUITests=true` flag.

## Boilerplate and Gitpod

Integrated functions in VSCode was used to create a boilerplate for the project. This ensured that everything was added correctly.
We then followed up with changing **pom.xml** with the correct version for running on silicon macs and adding dependencies for testing.

Gitpod-tag got added to the README.md in root to enable remote work and easy access for the course-team
