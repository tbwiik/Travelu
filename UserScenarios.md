# User scenarios

## Grandma looking back at memories
As a grandma with four curious grandchildren, I want to have an overview of the places I have been so that I can show the children what I have done throughout my life. I want to be able to look back at the good memories I have created over the years. This will also help me find out where I want to travel later.

The user needs to be able to create a list of places the user has been and what they have done at these destinations. The user should be able to add new places the user has been.

### Important to be able to see
- When looking at destinations: a list of places the user has been.

### Important to be able to do
- Add new destinations the user has visited.
- Remove destinations in case the user added a destination by mistake.
