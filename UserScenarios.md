# User scenarios

## Travel journal
As a grandma with four curious grandchildren, I want to have an overview of the places I have been and what I have done there to show them what I have done throughout my life. I want to be able to look back at the good memories I have created over the years together with my kids and to see where I enjoyed myself the most. This will also help me find out where I want to travel later.
